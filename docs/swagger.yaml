    Wecome to the WalletChat API Documentation

    Please make note that some JSON data structures are shared for both input/output.
    Required input parameters will have a red * next to them in the data type outline at
    the bottom of the page, along with a comment.  This means when executing API functionality
    from this API page, some fields may need to be removed from the JSON struct before submitting.
    Please email the developers with any issues.
    Some JSON data structures are output only, and will be marked as such as well.

    v1 includes basic JWT Authentication, however some additional work is in progress to make this fully secure.
    except for AUTH functions, all /v1 endpoints must include "Bearer <JWT>" in all requests showing the Lock Icon"
    For this API Doc, use the "Authorize" button on the right hand side to ender "Bearer <JWT>" where the JWT will
    come from the return value of the /signin endpoint.  Please read the /register, /users/<>/nonce, and /signin
    descriptions to understand the login workflow via JWT Auth.

    v2 will include encyrption for DMs, private keys will be stored locally on client PCs
    with no way for us to recover any data which is encrypted.

        method doesn't proof to be fine grained enough, we could add a boolean relational table of read messgages per user.
